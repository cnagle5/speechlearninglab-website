## About the Lab

Welcome to the Speech Learning Lab at the University of Texas at Austin. Our lab is built on reciprocity and shared investment. Lab members work on projects that fit their interests and expertise. We run design, pilot, and run projects and present and publish together, which creates opportunities for hands-on research and professional training. 

### Research Focus

Our research focuses on speech learning in additional languages, including the perception, production, and comprehension of speech. We work across several languages, but much of our work is related to Spanish as an additional language.
